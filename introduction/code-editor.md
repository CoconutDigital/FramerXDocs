# Code Editor

## Bring your own code editor

Unlike Framer Studio, Framer X will no longer feature a code tab . Instead, you are now free to use whatever code editor you prefer as Framer will automatically choose the code editor you have selected as your default in your system preferences. If no app is selected as your default then Framer will try to open your code components with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Updating your default code editor

* Go to a  `.TSX`  file
* Right-click and choose  `Get Info` 
* At the   `Open With`  section you can select the desired app you wish to use as your default.
* Last but not least, click  `Change All`  and then choose  `Continue` 

{% hint style="warning" %}
You may have to restart your code editor in order for Framer X to notice the new default choice.
{% endhint %}

## Themes

Framer has created the Syntax Theme. These are awesome looking themes for both Visual Studio Code and Atom, so that you can code your components in true Framer style.
