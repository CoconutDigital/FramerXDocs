  Thanks and congratulations for being part of the Framer X beta and trying out
  a truly new design tool. This guide should give you a great overview of what's
  possible.

# Welcome to Beta 1

## How You can Help

We will use your feedback to improve, accelerate the rollout and ensure the highest quality at general release. Typical things we would like feedback on are:

* **Bugs and Issues –** Things that break and we should fix. Ideally with a screen recording, the file and general errors so we can try to reproduce.
* **First Experiences –** Things that seem odd when you explore the app for the first time, often things that are hard to still see for us.
* **Real World Usage** – What do you run into when you try to build design systems, import existing components, etc.

You can reach us via Facebook, Slack, Email or Twitter.

## How to Think About Framer X

Framer X is quite different from other design tools. It aims to blend canvas and code, design and development, to support a new more natural and efficient way of designing digital products.

Framer X is more like [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/editor) than like Photoshop. An [**IDE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) **for design**, if you will. Framer X can do many different things from wire-framing to visual design to screen flows to design systems to interactive component programming. We expect most users to only use what they need based on their project or skill level.

Framer X is both the **most easy and most advanced** design tool. A few most advanced users will build components for everyone else, so the majority of users won’t write code, but visually compose interfaces with components built by others.

Framer X won’t generate code for you, but instead use the code you \(or someone else\) wrote. Auto generated code almost never ends up in production, so it's better to have a tool use the code that is being used. If you already have React components built, they should work in Framer X with minimal effort.

## Before You Begin

While Framer X looks very similar to other design tools on the surface, there are some differences that can throw you off if you are not prepared. These are the most common ones we see:

* Understand the main ideas behind Framer X \(see previous [paragraph](welcome-to-beta-1.md#how-to-think-about-framer-x)\).
* Learn the difference between
  * Frames and Shapes \(or, layout and drawing\).
  * Design Components and Code Components.
* Learn how to use the command key to:
  * Select any object directly on the canvas independent of the hierarchy.
  * Temporarily disable the hierarchy guessing system while manipulating objects.
* Learn how to import your designs from Sketch through copy paste.

## What is missing in Beta 1

Betas are never complete. The features below are currently missing but planned for general release. You should see them land with every new update.

* Cloud uploading and sharing.
* Mobile device previewing.
* Advanced preview options \(devices\).
* Editing components from installed packages.
* Converting design components to code \(jsx\). 
* Framer.js Library: gestures, events, interpolation, components.

Let us know if you think anything is missing.
