# Getting Started

## Documentation

Welcome to the Frame X Docs. This documentation should, when finished, include everything you need to know about our new product. 

_We are still updating our docs. If you are missing any topics please let us know via support@framer.com and we will try to have it in here soon._   


## Minimum Requirements

In order to use the latest version of Framer, you must be running Mac OS X El Capitan \(version 10.11.2\) or higher. Framer runs perfectly on every Mac, from a MacBook to a Mac Pro.

## Getting Framer

### Downloading Framer X {#downloading-sketch}

During beta, Framer X will be invite only.

### Framer Subscription {#downloading-sketch}

Framer subscriptions come in three different variations. You can find our current pricing and features at our [pricing page](https://framer.com/pricing).

* **Trial**: Temporary subscription for evaluation only.
* **Personal:** Personal subscription for individuals, freelancers and students.
* **Company:** Commercial companies teams with &gt;2 users.

Framer pricing was designed to support a sustainable business model that keeps Framer affordable for a diverse range of individuals through focusing on charging commercial companies for the value that they get out of our product. Commercial teams trying to use licenses aimed at individuals will receive increasingly stronger suggestions to correct license types.

If you are an individual that for any reason still cannot afford Framer please let us know and we are happy to work something out with you. We want everyone to be able to use our tool to become the best designer they can be.

**Note:** If you are a current individual Framer subscription holder \(or buy one today\), it will be valid for Framer X too.
