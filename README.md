# Framer X

## How to Think About Framer X

Framer X is quite different from other design tools. It aims to blend canvas and code, design and development, to support a new more natural and efficient way of designing digital products.

Framer X is more like [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/editor) than like Photoshop. An [**IDE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) **for design**, if you will. Framer X can do many different things from wire-framing to visual design to screen flows to design systems to interactive component programming. We expect most users to only use what they need based on their project or skill level.

Framer X is both the **most easy and most advanced** design tool. We think a subset of more advanced users will build components for everyone else, so the majority of users won’t write code, but visually compose interfaces with components built by others. But if you enjoy writing code, Framer X will be the best environment to do so and we encourage everyone to explore it.

Framer X won’t generate code for you, but instead use the code you \(or someone else\) wrote. Auto generated code almost never ends up in production, so it's better to have a tool use the code that is being used. If you already have React components built, they should work in Framer X with minimal effort.
