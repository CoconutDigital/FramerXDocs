# Design Components

## How it works

Design Components are a powerful feature that will let you re-use elements easily within your document. It can be anything from a logo, icon-set, UI-kit or a complete design system. You can create a Design Component by right-clicking on a Frame and selecting "Create Design Component" or by using the shortcut "CMD+K". After your Design Component is created you will be able to find it in your Components panel.

## Master/Instance

Your Design Component is made up of two parts: A _master_ and an _instance_ \(which is a copy of the master\). When you make a change in the master then this will automatically be mirrored in its instances.

### Overrides 

#### Instance

If you want to override the master Design Component in one of the instances then select that instance and tweak the elements within the Frame. This will then only be updated within that instance, while keeping the other instances and master in tact.

#### Master

You can also override your master from within an instance so that it will be applied to all of the instances. You can do this by right-clicking the edited instance and choosing Design Component -&gt; Update Master from Instance.

## Store

If you have created something that you wish to share with others then you can package this together and release it to the [Store](https://framer.gitbook.io/framer/~/edit/drafts/-LIzedlX7J4suCCcvNB2/canvas/design-components-wip).
