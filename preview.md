# Preview

Framer X has a Preview window which allows you to see an accurate and live representation of anything that you are creating. And it does so interactively! Just hop into Preview mode by tapping the PLay icon in the top right corner or hit CMD + P to see it in action.

## Devices

When you create a Frame you can choose from a wide selection of preset devices. Once clicked, your Frame will automatically resize to the desired device. The Preview window will then automatically adjust itself and will, when in presentation mode, show your design on the selected device for a perfect representation.

_Framer X Beta does not currently feature the device-in-presentation mode. More about this will come soon._

## Selection

In Framer X we have improved our Preview window so that it will follow the selection on your Canvas. You will no longer need to go through the complete flow of your design to see the last tweak: Just select the last Frame and the Preview will showcase that screen.

## Presentation

When your prototype is finished and you are ready to show it to the world then go ahead and jump into Presentation mode by pressing CMD + Shift + F. Your prototype will then take full center and you will not be distracted by the rest of the UI. Perfect for testing it out.



## Mobile and Remote Previewing

View and interact with your native projects in context with our preview apps for iOS and Android.
