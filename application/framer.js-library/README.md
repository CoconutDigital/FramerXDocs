# Framer.js Library

## Overview

Framer X provides a library with a set of optional helpers for React to create animations for high fidelity motion design. Animations let you change any property over time on a curve like linear or spring. You can animate as many items as you like, build animation sequences and use animation events to respond to user events.

The Framer.js library will be [open source](http://github.com/koenbok/framer) and we will strive to support most major browsers so you can optionally use it in production environments if you like.  
  
**Note**: the Framer Library is completely optional for your components, you are free to use any library you like, or none at all.

**Note**: In the future \(past Beta 1\) the Framer Library will have:

* **Interpolation –** Tween between number ranges \(a new modulate\)
* **Gestures –** Advanced gestures and behaviors like swipe, pinch, etc.
