# Framer.js Library

## Overview

Framer X provides a library with a set of optional helpers for React to create animations for high fidelity motion design. Animations let you change any property over time on a curve like linear or spring. You can animate as many items as you like, build animation sequences and use animation events to respond to user events.  
  
**Note**: the Framer Library is completely optional for your components, you are free to use any library you like, or none at all.

**Note**: In the future \(past Beta 1\) the Framer Library will have:

* **Interpolation –** Tween between number ranges \(a new modulate\)
* **Gestures –** Advanced gestures and behaviors like swipe, pinch, etc.
