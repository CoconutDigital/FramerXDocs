## Export

This section covers exporting from Framer X. Export screens and assets to start developing your designs or copy CSS values for your next web design project.

Exporting works exactly as you’d expect. You can create multiple exports for a single frame or shape to cater to multiple resolutions. Simply select a layer and hit export in the bottom right corner of Framer. Select one of the pre-made presets or add your own. Adding a suffix to the preset will append this to your file name. Clicking the **suffix** dropdown allows you to save assets to organized folders.

You can export your Frames to:

* PNG
* JPG
* WEBP
* PDF

_You can also copy the CSS code from your Frame directly._

You can export your Shapes

* PNG
* JPG
* WEBP
* SVG
* PDF

And we support different sizes to export to, such as 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x and 4x.
