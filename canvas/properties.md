# Properties

Style elements of your layers like size, radius, fill, multiple shadows, gradients and effects. Use the alignment tools and live simulation to accurately position layers for instant responsiveness.

On the right side of the design canvas, you’ll find a properties panel. Much like any other graphics tool, it contains all the tools you need to style the properties of a particular layer. At the top of the panel is a series of align tool options. Use them to smartly position your layers within the frame and in relation to each other.

## **Frame Properties**

You can alter the properties of your frame, such as changing its fill color, size or position. To test the responsive nature of your frames, select one or more at a time to bring up its properties, then switch devices. If all your content is correctly aligned, it will automatically adapt to the new dimensions of your frame.

## **Layer Styling**

To view the styling properties of your layers, you can select one or more layers in the layer list or highlight them directly on your canvas. Framer contains all of the styling properties you would expect from a modern design tool.

### **Gradients** 

Gradients in Framer are based on the [CSS Model](https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/do-you-really-understand-css-linear-gradients-631d9a895caf). This means our gradients are simple—an angle and two color stops. Resizing a layer will not impact the gradients because it will stay true to its angle and automatically adapt to the layer size.

### Borders

Borders lets you add a border around any layer you create in Framer. You can control the color, width, and style of the border. Because Framer is web based, you’ll be able to set border styling and individual border size for the top, right, bottom, and left of the layer.

### Shadows

Framer allows you to shadows to your desired layer. From outer to inner shadows, you can stack a combination of as many shadows as you want.

**Effects** 

Effects add an extra set of styling capabilities, including blending modes to blend layers and colors, object blur to blur an entire object, or background blur to blur the layers behind it. There are also filters like Contrast, Grayscale, Hue Rotate, Invert, Saturate and Sepia, for enhanced photo editing.
